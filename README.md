# cells
#### Spreadsheet-like expressiveness for CLOS, the Common Lisp Object System.

Please check out the Wiki for motivation and general overview: https://github.com/kennytilton/cells/wiki

No documentation other than the test suite, but ping me for help. I am starting on a port to Clojure called **It's Alive!** here: https://github.com/kennytilton/its-alive and that will be better documented.

**It's Alive!** is pretty far along and in some ways exceeds Cells in capability and even has a benign issue fixed.
