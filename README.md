# cells
#### Spreadsheet-like expressiveness for CLOS, the Common Lisp Object System.

Please check out the Wiki for motivation and general overview.

n.b, This repository does not have my day-to-day working version of Cells. If you have issues with it lemme know and I'll take a few hours to bring things over.

No documentation other than the test suite, but ping me for help. I am starting on a port to Clojure.
